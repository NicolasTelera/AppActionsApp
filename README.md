# AppActionsApp

How to try it:
----

In order to be able to try this sample with the App Actions Test Tool plugin, you just need to:
- download the code
- update the `applicationId` in the app level `build.gradle` with the application id of an app that you have on the Google Play Console
- if you have none, juste upload the updated version of this sample with your application id to the console (a draft is enough)

Be sure that you are logged with the same Google account on the Google Play Console, in Android Studio and on your device.
The Google Assistant also must be configured to locale en-US.

Use one of those three invocations in the test tool to launch a feature in the Assistant:
